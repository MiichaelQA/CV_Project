# Cv_Project

Hello, glad to see you here in my CV project!

This project will show you my knowledge in working with Selenium WebDriver, JIRA, ChroPath, KatalonRecorder, IntelliJ IDEA, Page Object 
and of course GitHub!

My full process of testing by tools listed above was shown in the GIF inside CV 
and here you can read my code and look how was the integration of reporting in TestRail and JIRA implemented
